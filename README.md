# Suggestion Box
*Exploring forum functionality with AngularJS*

## Synopsis
This project is about exploring forum functionality using AngularJS. To do that, I'll be creating a 'Suggestion Box' app that will allow its users to:
* Look at suggestions others have made
* Write and submit a suggestion
* Upvote suggestions
* Comment on suggestions

## About
Recently, I've gotten into AngularJS as a framework due to its popularity and general awesomeness. I've used Codecademy to teach me the basics, and as a 'final project' they have you create something on your own. I like challenges, so I'm going to prove I can do it!
